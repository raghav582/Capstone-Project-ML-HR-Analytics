# Problem description:
Whenever an employee leaves an organization, he takes away the experience, the skill, the knowledge that he/she gathered over the period of time within the organization with him/her, whichaffects the organization and the impact is not only restricted to that butalsobrings with it the task offinding a suitable replacement.Most of the times the suitable replacement is hired from outside the organization. Hiring an employee is again a time and money consuming process. 
# Problem 1:
The HR department of a multinational companywould like to understand the reasons for premature exit of experienced employees using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. For achieving this they have to try to:
o Explore the dataset and check if the data can be used as is
o Relation between satisfaction level and working hours on the exit of employees
o Effect of satisfaction level, department, promotion in last 5 years and salary level on exit of employees
o Comparing the previous models with the Maximum margin classifier for studying the effect of satisfaction level, recent performance of the employee, working hours on exit of employees
o Build a simple Artificial Neural Network modelto predict the exit of employees 
# Instructions for problem solving:
